# Footie 365

Footie 365 is a web application blog designed for visitors to read reviews on recent high profiled football matches, comment on these matches and for users to interact with each other. Inspirational came from sports news sites, reddit and to a small extent Pintrest. 

Visitors to the site can read the reviews and there is a call to action with the register / sign up button on the top navigation bar of the site, where they will be taken to the sign up form requesting a username and password as mandatory fields with an option email address. After registering an creating an account the user can then proceed to log into the site and enjoy full benefits of becoming a member such as the ability to comment on the posts on the site, like or unlike posts and also the ability to interact with other members of the site in the comments section.

Users already registered can login upon landing on the homepage, which is a tidy grid of "match cards", containing a title and in some reports a sub-title underneath. The user can click to take them into the full macth report page where they have a form on the page to leave their comment. It is also where the user can like or unlike a match report. The User can create a comment, read other comments and the report, after liking a post if the user decides they've changed their mind they can update their like by unlikng a post.
