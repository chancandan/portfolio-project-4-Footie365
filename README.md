# Footie 365

Footie 365 is a web application blog designed for visitors to read reviews on recent high profiled football matches, comment on these matches and for users to interact with each other. Inspirational came from sports news sites, reddit and to a small extent Pintrest. 

Visitors to the site can read the reviews and there is a call to action with the register / sign up button on the top navigation bar of the site, where they will be taken to the sign up form requesting a username and password as mandatory fields with an option email address. After registering an creating an account the user can then proceed to log into the site and enjoy full benefits of becoming a member such as the ability to comment on the posts on the site, like or unlike posts and also the ability to interact with other members of the site in the comments section.
