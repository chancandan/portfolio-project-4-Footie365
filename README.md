# Footie 365

Footie 365 is a web application blog designed for visitors to read reviews on recent high profiled football matches, comment on these matches and for users to interact with each other. Inspirational came from sports news sites, reddit and to a small extent Pintrest. 

Visitors to the site can read the reviews and there is a call to action with the register / sign up button on the top navigation bar of the site, where they will be taken to the sign up form requesting a username and password as mandatory fields with an option email address. After registering an creating an account the user can then proceed to log into the site and enjoy full benefits of becoming a member such as the ability to comment on the posts on the site, like or unlike posts and also the ability to interact with other members of the site in the comments section.

Users already registered can login upon landing on the homepage, which is a tidy grid of "match cards", containing a title and in some reports a sub-title underneath. The user can click to take them into the full macth report page where they have a form on the page to leave their comment. It is also where the user can like or unlike a match report. The User can create a comment, read other comments and the report, after liking a post if the user decides they've changed their mind they can update their like by unlikng a post.

# Features
## General
### Navigation Bar

<details>
<summary>Navbar</summary>

![Navbar](readme-docs/site-images/navbar.jpg)
![Navbar](readme-docs/site-images/navbar-loggedin.jpg)
![Navbar](readme-docs/site-images/admin-navbar.jpg)
</details>

The site's navigation bar is featured across all pages.

The navigation bar displays "Home", "Login" and "Sign Up" for all unregistered visitors to the site as well as to registered members who are logged out. When viewing the site on a smaller screen such as on a mobile, the navibar collapses froma  list to a hamburger menu which when clicked toggles the list in and out of view for the user.

When a regsitered user is logged into the site they will see both the home page and logged out option on the navbar.

This narbar is based on "navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-white" from Bootstrap.

The logo can also be seen on the navbar and when clicked from any part of the site will always bring the user quickley back to the home page, as it's an index page link. This logo was made with Designevo's Logo generator, details of which are discussed further down this report.

### Footer

<details>
<summary>Footer</summary>

![Footer](readme-docs/site-images/footer.jpg)

Just like the navbar, the footer is featured across all of the site's pages. It contains social media icons which are also clickable links to their respected site's homepage. When Footie365 moves on from the MVP stage these will take the user to proper social media pages of Footie365. Here in the footer the user can also see that the site is currently just for educational purposes only.
