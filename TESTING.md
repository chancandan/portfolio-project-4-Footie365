## Lighthouse

Inside Google Chrome's DevTools I used Lighthouse to check the website's performance, SEO, best practices and accessibility.Below are some screenshots of Footie365's performance results.

<summary>Home Page - Not Signed In</summary>

The first initial testing was not bad. Best practices and accessibility scored really well. SEO wasn't bad but could be improved upon, however, this has not been covered in the course yet so it will have to go into a could-do issue for the site's development. Performance is just about adequate and will need looking at provided there is time before the project's MVP deadline. Given more time I'm confident I can increase the performance of the site. For now as a MVP this score isn't bad.

## Manual Testing

Behaviour Driven Development (BDD), is a process used to test user stories in a non-technical way, meaning any user can test an app's or website's features.

### User Story Testing
</br>

- As a Site User I can visit the homepage where I can see the website's function and be encouraged to register

<details>

<summary>Test Results</summary>


The register link / button is clearly visible and the website's goal is conveyed by the nature of the featured images on the homepage, as well as the logo. Therefore, this passes its test.

</details>
</br>

- As a Site User, I can sign up to register for an account, so that I can sign in to gain access to the website's features

<details>

<summary>Test Results</summary>


This passes testing because the registration form is clear,easily accessible and it is easy to understand..

![Register](readme-docs/testing/registration_form.JPG)

</details>
</br>

- As a Site User I can sign in to my account so that I can gain access to the app'ss features

<details>

<summary>Test Results</summary>

This passes the testing because the sign in form is clear, easy to access and only requires 2 credentals. 

![Sign In](readme-docs/testing/sign_in_test.JPG)

</details>
</br>

- As a Site User I can Sign Out so that I can leave myself signed out on public spaces, change accounts or allow someone else sign in on the same device. 

<details>

<summary>Test Results</summary>

This passes its test because the sign out function is accessible, easy to find and easy to comprehend.

![Sign Out](readme-docs/testing/sign_out_test.JPG)

</details>
</br>

- As a Site User I can navigate to and view the Home page when signed in so that I can choose a match report to read.

<details>

<summary>Test Results</summary>

This passes testing because you are automatically redirected to the Home page after signing in and also always have the option of clicking the Footie365 logo or the "Home" option on the navbar to get there. Once there the user can choose which match report they would live to read.

![Index](readme-docs/testing/index_test.JPG)

</details>
</br>

- As a Site User I can hover over a match report, click it and be brought to that match report view page where I can read the full report.

<details>

<summary>Test Results</summary>
</br>
</br>

This passes testing because when the user hovers over the match report title the colour changes on hover to a darker shade of black. Once clicked the user is brought to the match report view page. These actions can both be seen in the below screenshots.
