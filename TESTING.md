## Lighthouse

Inside Google Chrome's DevTools I used Lighthouse to check the website's performance, SEO, best practices and accessibility.Below are some screenshots of Footie365's performance results.

<details>
<summary>Home Page - Not Signed In</summary>

The first initial testing was not bad. Best practices and accessibility scored really well. SEO wasn't bad but could be improved upon, however, this has not been covered in the course yet so it will have to go into a could-do issue for the site's development. Performance is just about adequate and will need looking at provided there is time before the project's MVP deadline. Given more time I'm confident I can increase the performance of the site. For now as a MVP this score isn't bad.
